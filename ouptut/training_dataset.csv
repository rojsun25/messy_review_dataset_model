z and the windows keys). i turned over the box and dumped everything and voila! the missing keys fell out. not off to a great start but i slapped those keys on (which was very straightforward meaning that replacing keycaps in the future will be relatively easy) and plugged in the receiver to my laptop. no setup or 3rd party software necessary,positive
you've to press too hard,neutral
youtube.we can't adjust brightness of tv.,neutral
you'll need to move it so many times slowly on the whole cloth.steam amount is fine but design is such that you can't press it hardly on to the cloth during ironing.so overall do keep in mind before buying that it's only for emergency & travel purpose for de-wrinkling already ironed clothes.,neutral
you won't miss out on much just a bit of bassgreat buy though,positive

you need some kind of support at the back - just hanging on the hanger is not enough. the manufacturer should have given a though on this and could have added an accessory either free of cost or at additional charge.well so - if i get more information i will update,neutral
you need a long nail to switch it on/off but is strong enough to resist a hard stroke when you force it to off with your nailless fingers.precision and laser: 10/10: precision is just what most mouses have which is accurate and the laser is invisible (no annoying light in the bottom).buttons: 7/10 - buttons produce a slight noise on click and after a long usage the left button is shaking slightly.overall ratings: 9/10the main reason for you to buy this: its battery efficiency,positive
you might wanna cover these with cable raceways or even paint them like i am planning to do.,positive

you can make an arrangement to hang the clothes on a wall hanger and remove lint by keeping your neck straight.other than that it is a good product and can be tried.thanks,positive
you can literally feel the space opening up. all the instruments feel individual and sound separated. fireflies (by owl city) sounds lovely and all the strings sway in the centre while the various zaps and buzzes surround you. it's really great for the price!  1.2 treble and mids: clean and clear. the bass doesn't overpower them and feels just right. the vocals come out clearly and all the instruments don't interfere with it (drive home by steven wilson sounds great!).  1.3 bass: punchy and tight. i love how it fizzles in 'bonfire' (by knife party) and how it reverberates in 'turn down for what' (by dj snake). 'breakin' a sweat'(by skrillex,positive
you can go for this one. also tried dual feature i.e. charging power bank & at same time charging phone and it works well no problem. did not face any problem with power bank heating issue while charging phone or itself. type c charging port for power bank is good so you don't have to carry two different cables and type a usb cables are hard to find.few cons what i felt after using1. charging cable provided along is of no use,positive

writing this after using it for two months --pros -1. noiseless button2. soft press3. lightweight4. good build quality5. non-eraseable button sign6. easy battery installation7. good support range8. all button work properly9. all 104 buttons are available10. low battery indicator (the indicator does not glow when you install the new battery. it glows only when the battery is low.)cons -1. no num-lock light2. no caps-lock light3. no scroll-lock light,positive
writing review after using more than month. product really helps during winter season / when you feel cold.adjustment for heat temp based on power watts available.there is a regulator available to adjust fan speed but it won't work by design. it works as like on / off  function,positive

write speed is 60-70 at normal with a minimal level of 65 and peaks at 156..in mobileupdatethe disappointing thing is reed speed... i got upto 90 mbps read and it won't goes beyond 90mbps but write speed sometimes peaks at 120 mbps... i got this memory card only for the purpose of read speed not for writing speed..because i won't use this in any action camera or dslr... only for mobile which needs atleast 150 mbps for smooth performance.....i am totally disappointed for my purpose but satisfied.. according to price..so my conclusion if you are looking for a memory card for 4k/8k recording you can surely go for it..i case of u are purchasing on seeing it's read speed and also for mobile it wouldn't be a better option...,positive

touch controls to receive or cut calls. or else play/pause music.but this dynamic use of mic have some bug. sometimes this change won't happens properly and mic will not work or the other bud which is inside box may have active mic started so the person you are talking to will complain about voice is not coming. or some time may be muffled audio.put both buds inside box and then take out again to reset it and it will work again properly.1 time i faced error that even after putting both buds inside didn't make them off and they continued connected to mobile.i connected box to charger and the issue resolved.you can put 1 bud inside ear and other hold in hand and keep close to mouth to get superior mic quality even in streets where a lot of noise is or in the office where you need to speak in very low voice.battery backup is almost same as claimed. you can watch movies,neutral

this is my second iqoo z6 pro and my humble advice to all the users and purchasers out there is that please do not update your device to the latest software version. doing so will definitely cause serious overnight battery drain issues. i speak from my experience. my first iqoo z6 pro 8gb is updated to the latest august security patch update and drains battery at the rate of 10 percentage overnight for no specific reason. the idle drain is very pronounced. however my second iqoo z6 pro which i purchased is still running on the original software version and has excellent battery back up with negligible idle battery drain . so i think it's best not to update till iqoo rolls out a better update resolving the battery drain issue,positive

the lint remover actually removes the lint :). it is not a gimmick but an actual working machine. it gives new life to the winter clothes which were of no use due to heavy lint all around. using this small machine you can remove lint and see the difference. i used it on 2-3 clothes and am very happy with the result. let me describe the pros and cons:pros:1. very easy to use2. removes any kind of lint3. it also removes lint that is not visible i.e. of the same color which gives rough look to the cloth making it look older. so your clothes look a bit like the new ones.4. lint is collected in a container that is easy to cleancons:1. the process is very very slow. you need to move the machine on the cloth surface a number of times.2. the build quality is plasticky like cheap toys. it may break if fallen on a hard surface.3. the cable length is very small. the plug comes off the socket easily. you need to sit very close to the socket making it a bit difficult to use sometimes.4. the lint collector comes off very often5. the rotor blades make a weird noise as if they are going to break.6. the biggest problem is that you need to sit for prolonged periods to make your clothes lint-free which strains your neck badly and if you are suffering from cervical then forget it. you will use it once and will never touch it again. however,positive

the kettle temperature will be kept warm at knob setting unless the knob is at the leftmost when it shuts off.  else the water will keep drying out until it dries out completely and then the kettle is supposed to auto shut off to prevent dry heating (i haven't tested this though).  these are mentioned in the manual.  so this can be thought of as a warmer + boiler.  so you cannot leave the kettle unattended thinking that it will auto shut off like other kettles when the water has started to boil.  i assume this is designed this way to allow a bit of cooking for those who want to use it in that manner.accessories: cannot fathom what the use is of the plastic bowl provided.  given that plastics can leach chemicals when heated,positive

tbh it's a good phone for your parents. of you are a heavy user then don't consider this phone.cons:-1. slow charging (this phone usually takes around 2 hours for full charge)2. in initial days you will be impressed by the battery consumption i.e it runs 1.5 -2 days after only charging once but after few days it comes back to normal3. you will not get features like slow motion etc etc. in this price range you can get these feature on other phone or mi variantsthis is my 15 days reviewhence i haven't tried every feature of the phonewill come back soon after using it for months,neutral

purchased this last month. it's good as working fine for me. size is bit small but you can easily toast 2 normal breads at one go. just make sure you fill same amount of stuff in both sandwich so that both gets heat properly from both side. cord is bit small but it's good if you have plug near your kitchen. at first use it smells like wire is burning but after next usage that smell will not appear. cleaning of the product is bit difficult as you can't wash directly under tap. you need to use clean cloth with wetted with water. you can use some liquid soap but make sure it gets cleaned with clean cloth. apply some butter or ghee on both side of bread before making sandwiches else it will stick to your plates in grill.,positive

note & result)ultra-mini bluetooth csr 4.0 usb dongle adapter is a great device with so much features providing from csr which you need to know what they deliver at the price tag. for good stability + more features to enable you should install the driver provided by the csr (csr 4.0 harmony driver) inside the package their is a cd. install the driver from the cd (recommended) don't just plug & play the bluetooth adapter as in this case it will use microsoft generic drivers which has basic feature + not reliable (not recommended) using the driver by the manufacturer (csr) will make the device more reliable + stable + advanced features. this usb bluetooth is recommended for every buyer who are looking for more than just bluetooth + advanced features.package items: (shown in pic)1. csr 4.0 usb dongle (main)2. driver mini cd (install the driver) [recommended]3. cardboard cover contain details (specification & features)specification: (shown in pic)1. bluetooth version 4.0 compliant (backwards compatible 3.0,neutral

i mostly have instant coffee but this time i bought some filter coffee from araku valley during my visit. i was not aware of the process that you can't have it like the normal coffee so i tried it like normal one and it failed miserably because the coffee seeds won't get dissolved there is no coffee smell in it. then i went online to understand the process where i came to know about this coffee maker. i bought it for 2cup coffee which cost me 299/-. you can get bigger one also for 4 or 6 cup. you can go through the process of how to make south indian filter coffee online. to me it does job very efficiently and finally i am able to have a good cup of filter coffee. now about the product it's not premium quality steel but it's a decent one and it's very easy to use. you fill the filter in morning and you can have the raw extract till night. so to me it's a value for money if you want to try filter coffee.,positive

good. serves the purpose. had to buy this as for some weird reason the amazon firestick (bern working for 3 years) is no longer working when connected to my samsung tvs hdmi port (all 4 ports). searching in google did not help as this issue seem to be common with samsung tvs but with no possible solution. so wanted to check if the firestick works in my computer monitor but the hdmi slot in the monitor was unreachable for a direct connection and hence bought this cable. the firestick worked well with monitor. what's even weirder is the firestick works fine when connected to the same samsung tv using this cable. problem solved,positive

giving this review after using it for 2 months.i am using 3 more cameras from other brands which are china made. i bought them 4 or 5 years ago and there are various issues with them. wanted to buy this qubo camera and give it a try as this is made in india and from the famous hero group. the product did live up to my expectation!!here are my observations:pros:- excellent in performance.- accurate in motion detection.- can connect anytime from anywhere if the camera is connected to the internet.- led turns red when there is no internet connectivity.- crystal clear vision even in night.cons:- had to struggle a bit in configuring it. the usability of the app is not easy to understand. figured out the right options to use after few trials. hence giving 4 star rating.- the led doesn't glow green when it is recording though the option is turned on.keep it up hero group and looking forward to more such great products from your organization!!,positive

( confirmed and checked using usb viewer by microsoft)  best rgb leds i've seen on a keyboard under 8k these things are bright & vibrant af  great clicks especially for a linear switch  decent enough build quality  angled usb c port at the side (life saver for  me) |  feels great for typing and gaming  looks great  con's: there aren't any con's if you get this keeb! but just to be nit-picky  1. i would say that the switch and keycap puller that comes with this board is better if not used as the quality of it a bit on the lower side and it has a tendency to damage switches while pulling them out  2. the software is sweet and simple but some more features can be added.  that's it,positive

feels weighty but not in a wrong way. the battery adds to it's weight,positive
feels strong and wont get damaged even if it was to fall from table height. the battery life is too good if used without leds. with leds it will last around 2.5 to 3 hours only. without led more than 5 hours for sure. dont expect too much bass and overal sound quality is good for what one is paying. justifies he price. initially i was using jbl go (version 1) but surely i can say jbl was way too better with bass than this one but obviously jbl wa double the price. go for it if u want a desent sound quality with fancy led lights. overall 4 star.ps- the size is actually larger that what it feels in the pictures.,positive

"""[updated]  overall you really get what you pay for. they serve the purpose of a decent pair of tws for basic quality calls and music listening. main problem i noticed was with the pairing and connection strength as they routinely lose signal for no apparent reason. once or twice i had issue of only one of the buds getting paired and had to reset the other one to get it paired.if you have paired these to one device and try to pair to another one without disconnecting from first it simply doesn't work. this is starting to get annoying but maybe i'll get used to it. we'll see.----------------------------------------------------------this is just day 1 review of these. got them for rs 898 on some offer on amazon. i'll post updates later on. hope this is helpful for anyone interested.package : the packaging is quite decent for such a low price. comes with the tws earphones fitted with medium earplugs fitted inside the case. also included are a very short usb c cable and two additional earplugs - small and large. package includes some noise stickers and a pretty good user manual and warranty instruction card.build : was immediately dissapointed with the plastic case as the lid was rattling and not confidence boosting. will use it for a while to see if my worries are unfounded. the earphones themselves are rather sturdy feeling in hand. they fit very snuggly into the case and there is no evident feel of them coming lose or rattling within the case.comfort : this is very subjective and each ear is different. it's one of the reaonss i wanted to get a cheap tws to see if i'm ok with the form factor for long hours. the prefitted medium size earplugs were not comfortable so i switched to the small size ones. and after about 20 mins i forgot i was even wearing them. the earbuds are very lightweight owing to the plastic build but upside is that they don't cause any strain even after an hour of continuous use. one thing to note is that if you have """"gandhi"""" ears then the fit might be a little awkward - i should know. my ears covered the touch areas of the buds so i had to fiddle around a bit if i wanted to do any of the touch actions. ymmv.sound quality : i liked them. i'm no audiophile but they have decent volume and satisfactory levels of bass and separation. i tried my usual test at https://youtu.be/j0a2prc_mqo and they fared quite well. the treble maxes out at 15khz post which you hear nothing at all but this is to be expected at the price point. there was noticeable vibrations creeping in at below 30hz but the l and r drivers seem to be matched well and all of the panning tests were quite decent. i feel this definitely punches above its price point.call quality : in a low to no outside noise environment the microphones were very good. there was no lag and the person on the other side said my voice was very clear. but things take a steep fall as soon as little noise is present and you start sounding like you're inside a well. seems the mics can't figure out how to filter out your voice so they end up trashing the call quality. overall you get what you pay for here.range : max i got was around 5m. not sure how they tested and got 10m as advertised. any disruptions like a wall will simply break the connection but they connected back automatically every time so far so i guess that's passable.pairing :------ update on 12th aug 2022  - - - - - -major issue here is that if already paired to a device like a laptop they simply are unable to be paired to another device like your phone. you have to unpair from the first device and then try to pair again. had issues like only one of the buds pairing as well.have to fiddle around to get it to work and is not convenient.---------------i don't have a phone to test the fast pair features - actually i'm not even sure these support it. anyway",neutral
